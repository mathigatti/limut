/*
x Use require.js
x Bring in basic play adapters
x Set up metronome
x Have perform/drummer module to play the drums
x Metronome should publish a beat signal for others to subscribe to
x Metronome sort out
x Some UI for rythm spec
x Following own advice, everything relating to beats should be together, not spread out by hex location...
x Split metronome
 x Beats module which can drive any performer
 x Metronome only does tempo and time signature
 x Num beats per measure must come from metronome
 x UI for metronome
x UI for drummer: what to play on each strength of beat
* Some more percussion instruments
 * Open and closed hats
 * Clave
 * Cymbal crash
 * Hand clap
? Too many moving parts between beats and drummer..? Or not..?
> suggest beats approach for drummer but with 'k', 's', 'o' etc
* Support more than one measures worth of beats; eg 8 rows for 2 measures of 4/4
* Better wiring
 * Beats' register with metronome
 * drummers and uis are wired up properly
 * UI nesting: beats ui inside drummers ui..?
* Harmony...
* Voicing module
* Chorus performer
* Bass performer
* Lead performer
* Control of scales?
* Global tension/darkness controls..?
* Control of meoldic shapes?
