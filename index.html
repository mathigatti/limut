/*
x Use require.js
x Bring in basic play adapters
x Set up metronome
x Have perform/drummer module to play the drums
x Metronome should publish a beat signal for others to subscribe to
x Metronome sort out
x Some UI for rythm spec
x Following own advice, everything relating to beats should be together, not spread out by hex location...
x Split metronome
 x Beats module which can drive any performer
 x Metronome only does tempo and time signature
 x Num beats per measure must come from metronome
 x UI for metronome
x UI for drummer: what to play on each strength of beat
x Beats refactor
 x Beats specifies drum instruments directly
 x Beats register with metronome
 x Beats is decoupled from drummer
 x Make beats into a thing that can be created, not a singleton
 x Make beatsUI into a thing that can be created, not a singleton
 x Drummer owns beats, drummer ui owns beats ui
 x Pass the values into beats from drummer
 x Compose beat ui inside drummer ui
* Harmony...
* Voicing module
* Chorus performer
* Bass performer
* Lead performer
* Control of scales?
* Global tension/darkness controls..?
* Control of meoldic shapes?
> more...
* Support more than one measures worth of beats; eg 8 rows for 2 measures of 4/4
 * And support forcing a different number of beats into a measure for polyrythms..?
* More flexible UI for beats
 * More touch friendly..?
 * Allow specifying mulitple values on a single beat/division
* Some more percussion instruments
 x Open and closed hats
 * Clave
