/*
x Use require.js
x Bring in basic play adapters
x Set up metronome
x Have perform/drummer module to play the drums
x Metronome should publish a beat signal for others to subscribe to
x Metronome sort out
x Some UI for rythm spec
* Following own advice, everything relating to beats should be together, not spread out by hex location...
* Beats becomes Rythm module which can drive performers
* Refactor: metronome is only tempo and time signature
* Harmony...
* Voicing module
* Chorus performer
* Bass performer
* Lead performer
* Control of scales?
* Global tension/darkness controls..?
* Control of meoldic shapes?
