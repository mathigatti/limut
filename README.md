Limut's audio files have been copied from FoxDot (https://github.com/Qirky/FoxDot), where they were obtained from a number of sources. Here's a list of thanks for the unknowing creators of FoxDot's sample archive.

    Legowelt Sample Kits
    Game Boy Drum Kit
    A number of sounds courtesy of Mike Hodnick's live coded album, Expedition
    Many samples have been obtained from http://freesound.org and have been placed in the public domain via the Creative Commons 0 License: http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ - thank you to the original creators
    Other samples have come from the Dirt Sample Engine which is part of the TidalCycles live coding language created by Yaxu - another huge amount of thanks.

If you feel I've used a sample where I shouldn't have, please get in touch!
